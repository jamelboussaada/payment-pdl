# Git Authentication Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
You're encountering a permission error when trying to push to the GitHub repository. The error message indicates that the GitHub user `jamelboussaada` is being denied access to the repository `jamel-boussaada/payment-pdl.git`.

```
ERROR: Permission to jamel-boussaada/payment-pdl.git denied to jamelboussaada.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

## Root Cause
After analyzing your Git configuration and SSH setup, I've identified the following issues:

1. Your SSH key (`id_rsa.pub`) is associated with a placeholder email (`your_email@example.com`) rather than your actual GitHub email.
2. There appears to be a mismatch between the GitHub account that owns the repository (`jamel-boussaada` with hyphen) and the account you're using to push (`jamelboussaada` without hyphen).

## Solution Steps

### Option 1: Add your SSH key to the correct GitHub account

1. Log in to the GitHub account that owns the repository (`jamel-boussaada`).
2. Go to Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key.
3. Copy your public key content and add it to this account:
   ```
   ssh-rsa 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 your_email@example.com
   ```
4. Try pushing again.

### Option 2: Update repository permissions

If both accounts are yours but have different usernames:
1. Log in to the GitHub account that owns the repository (`jamel-boussaada`).
2. Go to the repository settings.
3. Navigate to "Collaborators and teams".
4. Add your other GitHub account (`jamelboussaada`) as a collaborator with write access.
5. Try pushing again.

### Option 3: Generate a new SSH key with the correct email

If you prefer to create a new SSH key:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
2. Generate a new SSH key with your GitHub email:
   ```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "113447640+jamelboussaada@users.noreply.github.com"
   ```
3. Add the new key to your SSH agent:
   ```
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```
4. Add the new public key to your GitHub account:
   - Copy the content of your new public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
   - Go to GitHub Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key
   - Paste your key and save
5. Try pushing again.

### Option 4: Use HTTPS instead of SSH

If you continue to have issues with SSH, you can switch to HTTPS:

1. Update your remote URL:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jamel-boussaada/payment-pdl.git
   ```
2. When pushing, you'll be prompted for your GitHub username and password (or personal access token).

## Verifying the Solution

After implementing one of the solutions above, verify it works by:

1. Running `git push -u origin main` again
2. If you're still prompted for a passphrase, enter it
3. The push should complete successfully without permission errors

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Verify your GitHub account ownership:
   - Ensure you're logged into the correct GitHub account
   - Check if you have multiple GitHub accounts and might be confusing them

2. Test your SSH connection:
   ```
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   This should return a message confirming your authentication.

3. Check GitHub's status page for any ongoing service issues:
